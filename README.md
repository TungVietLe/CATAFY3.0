# Overview
SAVE TIME. SAVE EFFORT. ALL-IN-ONE SOLUTION.\
Initial Problems: It's always take so much time and very complicated to set up an online store of your own. Even with no code development tools such as Webflow, Shopify, Wix, or WordPress, opening a store is still a pain with lots of steps and complication since they are not specialized in E-commerce but focus on a wider range of static pages only. That's why more than 200.000.000 businesses are not online yet despite the popularity of the Internet.\
Solution: A tool that help users create there online e-commerce in just a few clicks. Your store can be up running right away in less than 2 minutes.\
Target Users: Small Businesses, Start-ups, Young Entrepreneur, Content Creators, Influencers\

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).





## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
